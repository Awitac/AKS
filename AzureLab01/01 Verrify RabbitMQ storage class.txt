Verify the configuration of a StorageClass in Kubernetes

1. Display the details of the StorageClass:

   kubectl get storageclass rabbitmq-storage -o yaml

   This command will retrieve and display the YAML definition of the `rabbitmq-storage` StorageClass. 
   It will include information about the provisioner, parameters, and other settings.

2. Verify the Reclaim Policy:

   Look for the `reclaimPolicy` field in the displayed YAML. It should show the value `Retain`

For example, the output might look something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq-storage
provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-disk
parameters:
  storageaccounttype: Standard_LRS
reclaimPolicy: Retain
```

Please note that the above commands assume that you have the `kubectl` command-line tool properly configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster. 
Make sure you are running these commands in the same context where your StorageClass is defined.
